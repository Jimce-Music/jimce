This folder contains all unit tests, mainly for testing the functionality of library-like code integrated into this repository, for example for searching songs, etc...
Thus, no test db is required, but credentials for the different external APIs. They should be provided by the active developer in the local `.env` file or in the secrets for the GitHub Repo for the CI tests.
